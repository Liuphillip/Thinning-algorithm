# Thinning-algorithm

This is a thinning algorithm I came up with to use for a future project.
It is not perfect because the lines are not 1 pixel in width, but it does make the lines smaller

Step 1:
The program converts the image to a binary image

Step 2:
the program checks pixels and neighbors iterativley and creates a new image with uneccessesary pixels removed
